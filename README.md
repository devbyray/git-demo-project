# Git 101, the practical guide! - STEP 3: Branches

What is a branch?

A branch is a separate workspace, it’s like a bucket where you can fiddle around without screwing the production application.

You create branches when you are gonna make new functionality or features for your application.

So let’s get started with branches!

Check your branches

git branch

Update your local branches

git fetch origin

Create branch

git checkout -b branch_name

Push to a branch

git push origin branch_name

Pull changes from a branch

git pull origin branch_name

Switch branch

git checkout branch_name

Delete local branch

git branch -d branch_name
